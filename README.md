Make your daily interaction with BigQuery easier
with [JustFunctions](https://justdataplease.com/justfunctions-bigquery/) - a collection of open-source functions (UDFs)
to extend BigQuery capabilities.
You can use them directly in any of your projects or auto-deploy them to your BigQuery and generate insightful markdown
documentation.
